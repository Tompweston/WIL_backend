# Scope:

This project is to develop a full-stack web application which is encompasses a simple to-do application. The functionality of the web app is to be able to add, delete and edit tasks as well as check them as complete or have them unchecked inferring still needing attention. 

# Purpose:

The objective of this process is to give me a better understanding of the way that web tech stacks are set up and how different technologies communicate with each other. On top of this there is a desire to enable deployment of new updates to be automated and seamless through what currently seems to be GitHub Actions and to be secured via some authorisation method. 

# Technologies used:
- FastAPI
- Vue
- MongoDB
